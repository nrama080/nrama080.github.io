                <h2>What About Me?</h2>
                <p>My name is Nithiiyan Skhanthan, but you can call me Nith. I'm a second year computer science student at Univerity of Ottawa. My main areas of focus are web development and app development.</p>
                <p>I'm a pretty curious guy, I like looking at problems that I deal with day to day and the solutions computers can provide to streamline and make things easier. I spend alot of time tinkering with electronics and software development and try to learn new things along the way. I find causing problems and trying to fix them makes me better at not causing them.</p>
                <p>I have a deep passion for learning and creating with the cloud, and am getting certified in AWS, Azure, and Google cloud.</p>
                <p>Along with cloud services, I'm interested in IoT programming, Virtual Reality, Automation, Microservices, APIs, and Full-Stack web apps.</p>
