                <h2>What About Me?</h2>
                <p> I believe in having a growth mindset and am always looking to learn and enhance myself.</p>
                <p>Some of the skills I have been able to develop have been communication based (fluent in English, French, Tamil) and technical based (programming with Python, website building using CSS and HTML).</p>
                <p>My work experince has helped me expand on my interpersonal skills and establish positive relationships with various types of people. </p>
                <p>Along with work experience, some of volunteering experiences I have partaken in (research trainee, school club executive, assisting disabled individuals), have given me the change to cultivate skills necessary in my field, as well as give back to the community.</p>
